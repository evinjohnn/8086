## About

The **Intel 8086** is an 16-bit microprocessor widely used in early computing systems. This repository contains assembly language programs written for the 8085 microprocessor, covering basic arithmetic operations, conditional jumps, loops, and memory manipulation.

These programs were developed as part of the **Microprocessor Lab** curriculum at **Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT)**.

## Programs

Here is a list of programs included in this repository:

1. **Addition of Two Numbers** (`add (1).asm`)  
   - Adds two 8-bit numbers and stores the result in memory.

2. **String Concatenation** (`concat (1).asm`)  
   - Concatenates two strings and stores the result in memory.

3. **String Concatenation (Improved)** (`concatnew.asm`)  
   - An improved version of string concatenation with optimized logic.

4. **Multiplication of Two Numbers** (`mul.asm`)  
   - Multiplies two 8-bit numbers and stores the result in memory.

5. **String Replacement** (`replace (1).asm`)  
   - Replaces a substring in a string with another substring.
